                <h2>CLOTH COLLECTION DRIVE</h2>
                <div class="border_image">
                    <p>
                        With the coming of winters, the campus leaders embark on their mission to collect
                        unwanted warm clothes from their friends, college mates and departments to distribute
                        it among those who were in need of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The event sees the students going from class to class twice every week to collect
                        woollen clothes such as gloves, mufflers and sweaters of all sizes and types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These clothes are divided among the teams and taken home for checking, washing and
                        packing. After having ensured that the clothes were fit for distribution, they were
                        packed in packets and stapled neatly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our leaders and volunteers then go to slums,
                        streets and shelter homes to distribute the clothes collected.

                        Book Collection Drives are organised with much zeal and zest by all 
                            campus units of Leaders for Tomorrow. The event helps the campus leaders, 
                            members and volunteers understand the importance of sharing knowledge and equip as many people as possible with the weapon of information for the development of our nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a part of this event- which is backed by a huge publicity campaign on campus, through hand made posters, SMS, emails and announcements- cartons were set up in various prominent students joints with our logo and tags where students were encouraged to drop old story books and general knowledge books so that the volunteers could distribute among those who needed it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a follow up activity, the collected books are categorised into various sections such as – science, fairy tales, moral books etc and donated to various shelters and schools for the lesser privileged; especially those that were seeking to build libraries or didn’t have any provision for such exposure.

                        LFT Leaders visit shelter homes and other ngos to spend time with those who live
                        there. This is to ignite the social consciousness in the youth and also to instill
                        in them the values of compassion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The volunteers and leaders play games, read stories and participate in the daily
                        activities of the NGO they visit for a few hours as a part of this programme.

                    <p>
                        Often the shelter homes visited through this programmes are also beneficiaries of
                        our collection drives.

                        We at Leaders For Tomorrow believe that it is not enough to just ask the youth to
                        find the hidden leader in them. They must also be trained in leading social change.
                        Thus, we engage our leaders and volunteers in ‘Be The Leader’ Programme that focuses
                        on Youth Advocacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The programme is headed by our college campus leaders across all major colleges
                        of Delhi University and IP University. During the programme, they go to different
                        classrooms and prominent places on campus to interact with them on the need for
                        youth to get involved in social change.
