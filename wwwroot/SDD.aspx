                            Even as there is an increase in the number of youngsters graduating in India, 85%
                            of our graduates are found unemployable. There is a need to bridge the gap between
                            what is taught in textbooks and the needs of various sectors. i.e. we must enhance
                            the employability of our youngsters.</p>
