                            To spread the message of the importance of maintaining a clean surrounding, we launched
                            a cleanliness drive, Cleanathon.</p>
                        <p>
                            This academic year, Cleanathon went to 100 campuses with the mission to pick up
                            litter, plastic and other garbage that was otherwise made unseen by passers-by.
                            The campaign was concluded with a rally across the arterial roads of North Campus,
                            Delhi University, where 110 college coordinators of Leaders for Tomorrow came together
                            to spread the message for a clean and green Delhi.</p>
                        <p>
                            The campaign was a symbolic effort to ignite the consciousness of the college students
                            towards the basic steps that can be taken by us to make our city cleaner instead
                            of waiting for the governing systems to take action.</p>

                            and adopting a plant. These students come together to plant saplings in over 100

                            The mission of LFT’s battle against drugs and ragging is to tell the youth that
                            for a healthier life, they must respect themselves by staying away from drugs and
                            respect others by staying away from any activity associated with ragging.Thus the
                            campaign is titled ADAR (meaning respect in Hindi) to help the students associate
                            with the cause.</p>
                        <p>
                            This year, ADAR Campaign was bigger than ever as it was conducted in partnership
                            with the Delhi Police. The police showed immense support by helping the volunteers
                            take strict action in case of ragging and by providing valuable information on substance
                            abuse and ragging.</p>
                        <p>
