                        To take forward our dream of empowering the youth with skills that will help them
                        contribute to the development of the nation, we launched Igniting Young Minds (IYM)
                        – a life skill education programme for the less privileged in 2010.</p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to enhancing the growth and development of children belonging to the
                        lower economic strata of society, IYM also provides an opportunity for young college
                        students to be socially responsible and use their acquired skills and knowledge
                        for the betterment of society.</p>
                    <p>
                        As a part of this initiative, the volunteers are provided with a student-teacher
                        logbook on guidelines for the programme and progress made by each student is closely
                        observed.</p>
                    <p>
                        This programme has been structured keeping in mind the academic schedules of college
                        students. Our volunteers contribute just 1 hour on weekends for a period of 8 weeks
                        to complete the programme successfully.</p>
                    <p>
                        The topics and subjects covered include: moral values, confidence building, spoken
                        English, etiquettes and manners, personal hygiene and general knowledge.</p>
                    <p>
                        This year, IYM was able to make a huge impact by reaching out to nearly 1000 students
                        from across the city with a volunteer taskforce 450 youth volunteers from the LFT
                        Clubs in various campuses</p>
